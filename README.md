**Author**: Xin Deng
**Version**: 1.0.1 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

Build our own custom Express server in Node.js. We will server our front end static files.


## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

Hook up a front end React application with a back end server
Create an Express server from scratch



## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
REACT, JavaScript, APIs, Axios and are used.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

- 12-05-2023 2:30pm - Application now has structures and files needed to start
- 12-05-2023 11:32pm - Application now has backend getting right data

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

1. A question within the context of this lab assignment.
    - I don't understand how to get localhost working to debug. I'm collecting server errors like pokemon cards like what "hundreds" number am I going to get next...
1. An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment.
    - I had an ah-hah moment when Brandon showed me how to get local host to work but then I forgot... I thought it was a plug and chug lab since we already written the weather function yesterday, but wow it's so complicated. 
1. How long you spent working on this assignment.
    - 9 hours and I'm still not done. I stayed up till 6:30am to finish lab07 and I have a feeling I will tonight as well.
