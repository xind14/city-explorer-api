1. A link to your public Trello board.
1. A question within the context of this lab assignment.
- My map rendered in the preview and in the live server and now it isn't working I don't get it. I'm really frustrated. I'm taking a loss on this lab. I'm tired....
1. An observation about the lab assignment, or related ‘Ah-hah!’ moment.
- There has to be a better way to debug, why am I being shown that things are working when they dont. CSS is still so confusing. 

1. How long you spent working on this assignment.
  - Almost six hours
